Eggs in a Basket

2 1-inch thick slices of cinnamon bread
1 tablespoon melted butter
1/2 tablespoon butter
2 eggs
1/4 cup warm maple syrup

Preheat broiler and place oven rack 4 inches from the heat source.

Brush both sides of both pieces of bread with melted butter.  Using a circular cookie cutter, cut a 1.5" diameter hole in the center of each slice of bread, being careful not to make any openings for the egg to run out of.  Melt butter in a 12-inch broiler-safe skillet (such as cast-iron or AllClad) over medium-low heat until foam subsides.  Place the bread slices in the pan, along with the holes that were cut from the center.  Cook for about 2 minutes or until the underside of the bread is slightly browned (leave it on the light side, it will be cooked more later).  Turn the bread over, then put one egg in each hole and cook for about 5 minutes or until the egg is cooked about halfway through.  Carefully drizzle 2 tablespoons of maple syrup over the bread (not the egg), then place the whole arrangement in the broiler.  Cook until the egg white is cooked and the bread is browned and crispy.

Serve immediately with remaining two tablespoons of maple syrup.
