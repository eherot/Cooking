1 1/2 tsp active dry yeast
2 cups flour
1/3 cup sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1/3 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup milk
1 jumbo egg
1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
2 tbsp butter, melted

In a large mixer bowl, combine yeast, 2/3 cups flour, 3 tbsp sugar and salt. Heat 2 2/3 tbsp butter with milk until warm (125°F). With mixer at low speed, add milk mixture to dry ingredients; scrape bowl and beat at high speed 2 minutes. Add egg and 1/3 cup flour; beat at medium speed for 3 minutes. Add remaining 1 cup of flour to make a stiff dough. On a lightly-floured surface, knead until smooth and elastic. Place in a greased bowl; turn dough to coat surface. Cover and let rise in a warm place, free from drafts, until doubled, about 60 minutes. Punch down dough, knead lightly, divide into thirds; cover and let rest 10 minutes. Combine remaining 2 2/3 tbsp sugar and cinnamon. 

On a lightly-floured surface, roll out  dough to a 15 x 9-inch rectangle; spread with the remaining softened butter and sprinkle with the sugar-cinnamon mixture. From the long side, roll as for a jelly roll; fold ends in, bringing them together in the middle and seal. Twist gently.* Place in a greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 2 1/2 -inch loaf pan.

Cover and let rise in a warm place, free from drafts, until doubled, about 45 minutes. With a sharp knife, make several slashes ac ross each loaf. Drizzle with 1 1/2 tablespoons melted butter. Bake in a preheated 325°F oven for 35 to 45 minutes or until done. Brush with remaining melted butter, cool 5 minutes in pan and remove and cool on a wire rack.
