# Peach Ginger Ice Cream

## Ingredients

1 cup heavy cream<br/>
1 cup milk<br/>
2 inch piece of vanilla bean<br/>
1 whole clove<br/>
3 tbsp grated ginger<br/>
1 cinnamon stick or 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon<br/>

4 egg yolks

2 lbs peaches or nectarines, peeled (mostly\*), pitted, and cut into bite-sized pieces<br/>
7 tbsp sugar<br/>
1/8 tsp salt<br/>
4 tsp/20 ml bourbon<br/>
1 tsp lemon juice<br/>

1/3 cup candied ginger, chopped to 1/4" pieces

### Step 1

In a medium pot, combine cream, milk, vanilla bean, clove, ginger, and cinnamon. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then cover, remove from heat, and let steep for 1 hour.

### Step 2

In a medium bowl (large enough to hold 2 pounds of chopped peaches), mix together the peaches, sugar, salt, bourbon, and lemon juice and set aside, ideally for at least 30 minutes.

### Step 3

Once the cream mixture has finished steeping, whisk the egg yolks. Whisking constantly, slowly whisk about a third of the cream into the yolks, then whisk yolk mixture back into the pot with the cream. Return pot to medium-low heat and gently cook until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon (about 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer).

### Step 4

Drain the juice from the peaches into the cream mixture, then strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Churn in the ice cream maker, adding the candied ginger and the peaches when the mixture starts to have a non-liquid texture. Continue processing until done.

\*It's a matter of personal taste whether or not to peel the peaches. I would personally opt for peeling the peaches and not peeling the nectarines since their skin is a lot harder to remove.
