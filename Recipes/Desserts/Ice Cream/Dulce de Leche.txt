Dulce de Leche Ice Cream

1/2 cup whole milk
3/4 cups heavy cream
1/4 tsp vanilla extract
1/3 vanilla bean
1/4 cup sugar

Mix together milk and cream in a saucepain and heat over medium
heat to 170F, then turn heat to low.  Cut the vanilla bean in half
and scrape the seeds into the milk and cream mixture using a knife.
Drop the vanilla bean husk into the mixture.

Place sugar in aanother small saucepan over moderate heat.  Don't do
anything to it until it starts to melt, then stir it gently until it 
has completely liquified.  Continue stirring gently (you want to 
avoid creating any bubbles), just until it starts to change to a 
darker shade of caramel-brown.

Using a rubber spatula, scrape the caramel mixture into the warm milk
mixture.  It will solidify somewhat at first but just keep gently 
stirring the milk until all of the caramel completely dissolves.

Remove the pan from the heat and chill until lukewarm (~100F), then 
place the mixture in an ice cream maker.


NOTE: You can probably substitute agave for the sugar, however you
will first want to search for instructions about how to properly
identify when the agave hass "caramelized" since it can be a bit of
a touchy process.
